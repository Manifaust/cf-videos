## Deploy BOSH

### Download `kubo-deployment`

For most of this guide, we'll be working from within the bastion. Before you get started, copy the key for `k1-bosh@cf-sandbox-twong.iam.gserviceaccount.com` in this VM. We'll need it for later.

```sh
$ gcloud compute ssh k1-bosh-bastion
$ ls
k1-admin-service-account.key.json
```

Then, download the [latest version of `kubo-deployment`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases). This tarball contains the scripts necessary to deploy BOSH and then CFCR, it also contains the CFCR BOSH release itself. In this example we're going to download version 0.12.0 but you should download the latest version available.

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/releases/download/v0.12.0/kubo-deployment-0.12.0.tgz
$ tar -xvf kubo-deployment-latest.tgz
```

### Set up your configuration

After that, we'll generate a configuration template for deploying BOSH:

```sh
$ kubo-deployment/bin/generate_env_config ~/ cfcr-config gcp
```

This will create the `cfcr-config` folder, inside of which is the configuration file `director.yml` which contains the properties for deploying BOSH and later for deploying CFCR.

Our next step is to update `director.yml` with machine specific configuration, such as the network name, zone, and gateway.

Conveniently, if you followed the docs and used the project's terraform plan to create the bastion, there's script that does all of this for you located at `/usr/bin/update_gcp_env`.

If you didn't use the terraform plan, here's a list of the properties you need to update in `director.yml`:

```yaml
project_id: cf-sandbox-twong # your GCP project id
network: cfcr-net
subnetwork: k1-us-west1-subnet
zone: us-west1-a # the zone where you subnet is located
service_account: k1-node@cf-sandbox-twong.iam.gserviceaccount.com # the service account created in the earlier terraform script. It'll be used by the CPI

internal_ip: 10.0.1.252 # decide the future IP address of your director, must be in your subnet
deployments_network: my-cfcr-deployments-network # the internal name that BOSH will use place deployments. Can be whatever you want
internal_cidr: 10.0.1.0/24 # your subnet's CIDR, or at least a subset of it that you want BOSH to use to deploy machines
internal_gw: 10.0.1.1 # your subnet's gateway
director_name: k1-bosh # decide the future name of your BOSH director, can be user friendly and can be whatever you want
dns_recursor_ip: 10.0.1.1 # DNS IP for resolving non-BOSH hostnames
```

### Kick off the deployment

Use the `deploy_bosh` step to deploy BOSH, and pass into it the directory containing our configuration files, and the key for our `k1-admin` service account.

```sh
$ kubo-deployment/bin/deploy_bosh \
    ~/cfcr-config ~/k1-admin-service-account.key.json
```

Deploying BOSH takes about thirty minutes with GCP.

### After deploying

If you take a look at the GCP console again, you'll see that there's a new VM with a name like `vm-123abc` (yours will have a unique ID). This is the BOSH director that I described at the beginning of the guide.

Your SSH connection might have time out, so make sure you SSH into the bastion again.

Inside the `cfcr-config` director you'll notice two new files:

* `creds.yml` - which containers the passwords, CAs, and certs used by BOSH, and generated by our scripts. It'll also be used later to store all the CFCR related credentials.
* `state.json` - a state file which keeps track of which VMs BOSH is install into. It'll only be used when you update BOSH or when you have to destroy BOSH.


### (Optional) Try out some BOSH CLI commands

Getting familiar with BOSH is not a necessary part of this guide. However, it'll come in handy for troubleshooting or if you want to deploy and operate other software releases BOSH supports besides CFCR.

```sh
# make sure we have the right version
$ bosh-cli -v

# each environment is like a kubeconfig
$ bosh envs

# you'll get an error saying you're unauthorized
$ bosh-cli -e cfcr-config deployments

$ cd cfcr-config
$ ls

# copy admin_password
$ head creds.yml

# user name admin
bosh-cli -e cfcr-config login

bosh-cli -e cfcr-config deployments
bosh-cli -e cfcr-config vms
```
